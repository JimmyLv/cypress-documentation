We have put together contents for a 3-4 hour workshop that teaches how to test a modern web application using Cypress. The repository [cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress][workshop repo] has an example application, test exercises (with answers), speaker slides and notes, and should be a good starting step for anyone who wants to learn Cypress or teach it to others. The exercises cover the following topics (see workshop's [README file][workshop readme] for exact list)

- how to install and run Cypress
- how Cypress scaffolds files
- writing and running a basic test
- video recording and screenshot taking on failure
- Selector Playground
- testing XHR requests
- using data fixtures in your tests
- running Cypress tests on CI
- recording Cypress tests on dashboard

We hope this testing workshop proves itself useful in teaching developers and testers good Cypress practices.
